Jaijaz Emailer
==============

This Jojo plugin sets up an outgoing email queue and history. It uses Swiftmailer (http://swiftmailer.org) for sending.

It includes options to make use of Swiftmailer send throttling and a separate SMTP server.

There are features designed to work with SendGrid's (http://sendgrid.com) sending and event API's to allow for tracking.

The plugin queue for the email_queue table if using Send Grid's SMTP API will be put in as a category.
